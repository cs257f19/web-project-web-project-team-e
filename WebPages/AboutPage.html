	<p>This site is designed for those who are, for one reason or another, intrigued by Kickstarter, to learn about what factors—goals, time period, type of project, etc—result in failed or successful Kickstarter projects. Our goal is to help you learn about trends among Kickstarter projects, and if you have a project vision, to help you see how similar projects have performed historically.  Whether you are a curious user, a crowdfunding enthusiast, or an entrepreneur, we welcome you; this site has something for everyone. </p>
	
	<p>The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects">dataset</a>  we use contains over 300,000 Kickstarter projects dating up until 2018. The data is sorted into individual projects with a variety of attributes. These include things like the project name, the category (i.e. Film & Video, Music, Food), the start date and deadlines, the number of backers, and other important statistics. We have slighty modified the original dataset to make it easier to implement on the website.</p>
