The main changes we made to our code were to make the Data Source file run
correctly. Our shadow implementation worked correctly, but we did not completely
transfer everything we did from that file to datasource.py. Specifically, we
forgot to pass self into each of the methods. It was a minor mistake, but it
meant quite a bit. Also, we added a main method for Data Source, as a way to
test our implementations and now the file can run on its own.

Additional minor changes were also made to our code. We correct all the spelling
 mistakes that occurred in our code and comments. We also removed the Carleton
 password and added a little more detail to the file description about the data
 used and the purpose of the file. Finally, we gave better descriptions to some
 of our more confusing parameter names since there was no way to make those
 names completely self-descriptive.

We considered adding a Project class, which would create Project objects that
would store and return the various attributes of a given project in the data
table. We determined, however, that its utility would not extend beyond one or
two methods, and the extra steps that it would create for all of the other
methods would make things more difficult than necessary.
